## Build and run locally
The best way to build and run a local installation is via Docker. The following commands will run a development image with support for hot-reloading.

1. Checkout repository.
2. Run following commands. Make sure you have Docker installed.
```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
3. Open local installation in your browser via `http://localhost:5000`.

## Forums
The forums run on the commercial *IPS Community Suite* PHP software. This portion will not become available in the repository.
