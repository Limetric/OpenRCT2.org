  <h2>Install OpenRCT2</h2>
  <p>Use the links below to download OpenRCT2. The latest release is a stable, well-tested build, but may have fewer features than the latest development builds. The development builds are analogous to beta versions - they should work, but don't expect everything to be perfect.</p>
  <p class="flex">
    <a href="/downloads/releases/latest#windows" class="button colored" title="Download latest OpenRCT2 release" target="_blank">Download latest release</a>
    <a href="/downloads/develop/latest#windows" class="button colored" title="Download latest OpenRCT2 development build" target="_blank">Download latest development build</a>
  </p>
  <p>Note: If you wish to play online, it is recommended to download the latest development build, as most servers will be running this; you cannot connect to a server running a different version.</p>

  <h2>Select your RCT2 game files location</h2>
  <p>When you launch OpenRCT2 for the first time, OpenRCT2 will try to find your RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 installation. It will check the default locations that RCT2 is typically installed for all known releases. If it is unable to find it, or you have installed it to a different location, OpenRCT2 will show a dialog allowing you to select the directory containing your RCT2 game files.</p>

  <h2>End of Quickstart Guide</h2>
  <p>
    This concludes the Quickstart Guide. It's time to play OpenRCT2. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help on <a href="https://forums.openrct2.org">the forums</a>.
