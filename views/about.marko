        <h1>About OpenRCT2</h1>
        <p>
        	<em>OpenRCT2</em> is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2), expanding the game with <a href="/features">new features</a>, <a href="/changelog">fixing bugs</a> and raising game limits. The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.
